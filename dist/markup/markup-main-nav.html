    <h2>Main Navigation</h2>
    <p>Navigation is there to help, not the main focus. The main focus is the content, so the navigation is the last thing in the content hierarchy. Because of this, CSS is there to help us position the <code>nav</code> wherever we want it without sacrificing the semantics and structure of our content. A menu link is added at the top of the content to link down to the bottom. Later, we can use <code>JavaScript</code> and <code>CSS</code> to change the behavior of the menu anchor and display the <code>nav</code> in different ways.</p>
